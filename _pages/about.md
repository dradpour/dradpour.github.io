I am a <a href = "https://psychology.fsu.edu/graduate/programs/cognition-and-cognitive-neuroscience">Cognition and Cognitive Neuroscience</a> PhD Student and a member of the <a href= "https://michaelpkaschak.wixsite.com/lml-lab">Learning, Memory and Language Lab</a> in the Department of Psychology at Florida State University, working with <a href = "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4OkEqtMAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Michael Kaschak</a>. 
My research is centered on how people acquire new knowledge, with two main threads. The first is the mechanisms underlying conceptual integration (i.e., how people integrate new information into existing semantic and cognitive structures) and what drives flexibility and rigidity in that process. The second explores how people use AI tools and technologies as partners/aids in learning, and how these systems shape not only what we learn, but how we come to know and synthesize information in meaningful ways.

I am also interested in all things learning (language, social, logic, abstraction, self-awareness, etc.) and have recently grown particularly fascinated by how artificial intelligence disrupts (or enhances) the key mechanisms involved in the learning process. I am also a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_sciences">Learning Sciences</a> Research Intern at <a href = "https://www.brainscape.com/">Brainscape</a>, an app that allows students to study adaptive flashcards through integrating their metacognitive feedback. 

Previously, I was in the Department of Information Science at the University of Colorado Boulder, where I was working with <a href="http://michaeljpaul.com/">Dr. Michael Paul</a>. My past work looked at how we can leverage machine learning to better model language and social dynamics like <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.06836.pdf">gesture recognition for sign language</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.04421.pdf">emoji usage</a> and the <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-53352-6_16">spread of health misinformation</a>. After that, I spent a couple of years as a preschool teacher, both at a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montessori_education#:~:text=A%20Montessori%20classroom%20places%20an,and%20well%2Dprepared%20learning%20environment.">Montessori</a> and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_kindergarten">forest kindergarten</a>, which deepened my interest in how people acquire knowledge and led me to shift my focus to cognitive (neuro)science and the mechanisms that support learning. And way before that, I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a BA in Linguistics. ðŸ˜„
