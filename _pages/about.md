My name is Nelu (prounounced niːluː) and I am a linguist turned techie. My doctoral research focused on human-centered machine learning, specifically in leveraging machine learning algorithms to model language and social dynamics. 

After spending years working with so much data in academia (especially large language models like GPT-3 and BERT), I grew interested in the social implications and started work as a Compliance and Privacy Evaluator at Common Sense Media, assessing the privacy risks of the data that is constantly being collected and how different technologies adhere to privacy, security, safety, and legal metrics.
