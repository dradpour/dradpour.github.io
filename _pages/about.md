My name is Nelu (prounounced niːluː) and I am a linguist turned data scientist. My doctoral research focused on human-centered machine learning, specifically in leveraging machine learning algorithms to model language and social dynamics. 

After spending my time in academia working with so much data and large language models trained on copious amounts of data,  I have started work as a Compliance and Privacy Evaluator at Common Sense Media, assessing the privacy risks of the data that is constantly being collected and how different technologies adhere to privacy, security, safety, and legal metrics.
