I am a <a href = "https://psychology.fsu.edu/graduate/programs/cognition-and-cognitive-neuroscience">Cognition and Cognitive Neuroscience</a> PhD Student and a member of the <a href= "https://michaelpkaschak.wixsite.com/lml-lab">Learning, Memory and Language Lab</a> in the Department of Psychology at Florida State University, working with <a href = "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4OkEqtMAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Michael Kaschak</a>. I am interested in all things learning (language, logic and reasoning, social, etc.) and, in particular, how artificial intelligence disrupts (or enhances) the key mechanisms involved in the learning process. I am also a Learning Sciences Research Intern at <a href = "https://www.brainscape.com/">Brainscape</a>, an app that allows students to study adaptive flashcards. 

Previously, I was in the Department of Information Science at the University of Colorado Boulder, where I was working with <a href="http://michaeljpaul.com/">Dr. Michael Paul</a>. My past work looked at how we can leverage machine learning to better model language and social dynamics like <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.06836.pdf">gesture recognition for sign language</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.04421.pdf">emoji usage</a> and the <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-53352-6_16">spread of health misinformation</a>. After that, I spent a couple of years as a preschool teacher, both at a Montessori and a folk school, which deepened my interest in how people acquire and structure knowledge and led me to shift my focus to cognitive (neuro)science and the mechanisms that support learning. And way before that, I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a BA in Linguistics. ðŸ˜„
