I am a PhD Student in Cognition and Cognitive Neurosciencein and a member of the <a href= "https://michaelpkaschak.wixsite.com/lml-lab">Learning, Memory and Language Lab</a> at Florida State University. 

Previously, I was in the Department of Information Science at the University of Colorado Boulder, where I was working with <a href="http://michaeljpaul.com/">Dr. Michael Paul</a>. I have worked on topics in the realm of human-centered machine learning, mainly looking at how we can better model language and social dynamics like <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.06836.pdf">gesture recognition for sign language</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.04421.pdf">emoji usage</a> and the <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-53352-6_16">spread of health misinformation</a>.
