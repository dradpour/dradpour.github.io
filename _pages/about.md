I am a <a href = "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4OkEqtMAAAAJ&hl=en](https://psychology.fsu.edu/graduate/programs/cognition-and-cognitive-neuroscience">Cognition and Cognitive Neuroscience</a> PhD Student and a member of the <a href= "https://michaelpkaschak.wixsite.com/lml-lab">Learning, Memory and Language Lab</a> in the Department of Psychology at Florida State University</a>, working with <a href = "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4OkEqtMAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Michael Kaschak</a>. I am interested in all things learning (language, logic and reasoning, social, etc.) and, in particular, how artificial intelligence disrupts (or enhances) the key mechanisms involved in the learning process. I am also a Learning Sciences Research Intern at <a href = "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4OkEqtMAAAAJ&hl=en](https://www.brainscape.com/">Brainscape</a>.

Previously, I was in the Department of Information Science at the University of Colorado Boulder, where I was working with <a href="http://michaeljpaul.com/">Dr. Michael Paul</a>. My past work looked at how we can leverage machine learning to better model language and social dynamics like <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.06836.pdf">gesture recognition for sign language</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.04421.pdf">emoji usage</a> and the <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-53352-6_16">spread of health misinformation</a>. Prior to that, I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a BA in Linguistics.
