excerpt: 'This paper presents a novel application of deep convolutional GANs (DC-GANs) with an optimized training procedure to show that via incorporation of word embeddings conditioned on Google's word2vec model into the network, the generator is able to synthesize highly realistic emojis that are virtually identical to the real ones.
