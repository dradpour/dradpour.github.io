I am an MS Information Science graduate from the University of Colorado Boulder (CU Boulder) where I was advised by <a href="http://michaeljpaul.com/">Prof. Michael Paul</a> in the field of health informatics and <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/faculty/palmer-martha/">Prof. Martha Palmer</a> in the field of lexical semantics. I have worked on topics in the realm of human-centered machine learning (leveraging machine learning algorithms to model language and social dynamics) like <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.06836.pdf">gesture recognition for sign language</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.04421.pdf">emoji usage</a> and the <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-53352-6_16">spread of health misinformation</a>.
