My name is Nelu (prounounced niːluː) and I am a linguist turned computer scientist. Throughout my graduate studies, I worked on a number of different projects, ranging from ontology development to human-centered machine learning. I looked at how we can improve ontological resources, like <a href="https://propbank.github.io/">PropBank</a>, to better capture the idiosyncrasies within and across languages, as well as ways that we can leverage machine learning algorithms to model language and social dynamics, including <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.06836.pdf">gesture recognition for sign language</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.04421.pdf">emoji usage</a>, and the <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-53352-6_16">spread of health misinformation</a>. 

Motivated by my time in academia, I grew interested in the social ramifications of big data collection and have been working as a Compliance and Privacy Evaluator at <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/">Common Sense Media</a>, assessing data privacy risks and how different technologies adhere to privacy, security, safety, and legal metrics.
