My name is Nelu (prounounced niːluː) and I am a linguist turned computer scientist. Throughout my graduate studies, I worked on a number of different projects, ranging from ontology development to human-centered machine learning. I looked at how we can improve onontological resources, like PropBank, to better capture the idiosyncrasies within and across languages, as well as ways that we can leverage machine learning algorithms to model language and social dynamics. 

Motivated by my time in academia, I grew interested in the social ramifications of big data collection and have been working Compliance and Privacy Evaluator at Common Sense Media, assessing data privacy risks and how different technologies adhere to privacy, security, safety, and legal metrics.
